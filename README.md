# STM32F4xx "Black Pill" USB to I2S DAC Audio Bridge

## Features

* USB Full Speed Class 1 Audio device, no special drivers needed
* Isochronous with endpoint feedback (3bytes, 10.14 format) to synchronize sampling frequency
* Bus powered
* Supports 24-bit audio streams with Fs = 44.1kHz, 48kHz or 96kHz
* USB Audio Volume (0dB to -96dB, 3dB steps) and Mute control 
* I2S master output with I2S Philips standard 24/32 data frame
* Uses inexpensive Aliexpress-sourced STM32F4xx (I saw several models on Taobao around 10+ RMB with 22x2 pins they all should work).
* Uses inexpensive ES9023 DAC bus or self powered (with power board).
* Optional power supply board and amplifier
* Build support (Makefile option) for STM32F401CCU6 and STM32F411CEU6 boards 
* Optional MCLK output generation on STM32F411

## Wish List

* 32bit support
* MCLK support with other F401 models with 64 or more pins
* UAC 2 if ?

16bit data will be padded to 24bit. However 44.1 and 48 kHz data will NOT be resampled if you setup correctly. On Windows if you allow exclusive access for the device and you select WSAPI as Foobar's output, then it will switch to corresponding Fs to the actual sample rate of your source file when you play it. But otherwise there will be resampling on PC side.

## Endpoint Feedback mechanism

<img src="docs/feedback_endpoint_spec.png" />

Unfortunately, we do not have any means of measuring the actual Fs (accurate to 10.14 resolution)
generated by the PLLI2S peripheral on an SOF resolution interval of 1mS. So we calculate
a nominal Fs value by assuming the HSE crystal has 0ppm accuracy (no error), and use the PLLI2S N,R,
I2SDIV and ODD register values to compute the generated Fs value. For example when MCLK output
is disabled, the optimal register settings result in a value of 96.0144kHz.

Since the USB host is asynchronous to the PLLI2S Fs clock generator, the incoming Fs rate of audio packets will be slightly different. We use
a circular buffer of audio packets to accommodate the difference in incoming and outgoing Fs. 

The USB driver writes incoming audio packets to this buffer while the I2S transmit DMA reads from this buffer. We start I2S playback when the buffer is half full, and then try to maintain this position, i.e. the difference between the write pointer and read pointer should optimally be half of the buffer size.

Any change to this pointer distance implies the USB host and I2S playback Fs values are not in sync.
To correct this, we implement a PID style feedback mechanism where we report an ideal Fs feedback frequency
based on the deviation from the nominal pointer distance. We want to avoid the write process overwriting the unread packets, and we also want to minimize the oscillation in Fs due to unnecessarily large corrections.

This is a debug log of changes in Fs due to the implemented mechanism. The first datum is the SOF frame counter, the second is the pointer distance in samples, the third is the feedback Fs. As you can see, the feedback is able to minimize changes in pointer distance AND oscillations in Fs frequency.
